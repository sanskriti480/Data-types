Experiment-2 

Aim: To study and implement C++ Program Structure (Data Types).

Apparatus: VS Code or Programiz online C++ compiler.

Theory-
This program shows how different basic data types work in C++. It asks the user to enter values like a number, a decimal, a letter, a word, and a true/false choice. After each input, it prints what the user entered
and how much space it takes in memory using the sizeof() function.
1. int is for whole numbers and usually takes 4 bytes.
2. float is for decimal numbers with less precision, around 4 bytes.
3. double is like float but more accurate, and it takes 8 bytes.
4. char holds one single character like 'A' or 'z', and it takes 1 byte.
5. string stores a whole word or sentence, and the memory it uses depends on how long the text is.
6. bool is for true/false values (or 1 and 0) and uses 1 byte.

So, step by step, the program takes input for each type and helps us see how C++ handles them and how much memory each one needs. Itâ€™s a simple way to understand the basics of storing different kinds of data.

Conclusion - I learned various data types and also learned how to find out the size of each data type.
